    There are some moments in our lives that we wish we could capture forever. Grand moments, like a wedding or a celebration. Intimate moments, in the company of that special someone. Small moments of joy, like the earliest steps of a beloved little one. Moments like this call for more than expensive gadgetry or mere technical perfection.<br /><br />
  The fleeting, precious moments of our lives deserve creative thought, and an artist's finesse; a heart. Barely five years ago, Samik Ghosh—Jonak, to his friends—started off humbly with a camera in hand and a quiet passion in his heart. Jonak Photography saw the light of the day soon after. Samik's passion for photography would eventually lead him to quit his job as a researcher in Chemistry at a prestigious foreign university and devote himself to the play of lights and colours and the quest for eternal moments that make up a creative photo artist's life.<br /><br />
   As he likes to joke sometimes, he fancied photons hitting the sensor of the camera far more than the mix of chemicals with reagents in the laboratory; the hustle and bustle of life as opposed to the researcher's ivory tower. There has been no looking back for him after that. Samik's keen eye for enduring moments and a deep sensitivity towards human emotion has made him a much sought after figure in the wedding photography circles of India.<br /><br />
    He enjoys dabbling in all sorts of things, from candid wedding photographs to intimate portraits for couples looking to capture some treasured moments. In his spare hours, Samik likes to spend time with his gadgets and motorcycle, out in the world looking for new experiences.
